# ☁️ COTA | A Digital Lab by AllenMMC

**Cota** is a live, evolving project. It serves as a testing ground for hosting private services, digital products, and geometric experiments with zero monthly overhead. 

> "Cota is less of a finished product and more of a working project. I'm experimenting with how to host and sell services directly on the open web using a minimalist, high-performance tech stack."

## 🧪 Current Live Services
* **Private Spanish Tutoring:** A 1-on-1 conversational funnel powered by Stripe + Google Calendar. 
* **The Cota Terminal:** A command-line interface (CLI) built to process "signals" for navigation and easter eggs.

## 🕹 The Signal Log (Terminal Commands)
The **Cota Terminal** at the bottom of the page processes the following signals. These are used to navigate the archives and access services.

| Signal | Action / Destination | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `spanish` | Activates the Tutoring Funnel module | **LIVE** |
| `love` | Displays a hidden gratitude/easter egg message | **ACTIVE** |
| `myspace` | Redirects to the legacy MySpace-style profile | **ACTIVE** |
| `cota` | Loads `geometry.html` (Geometric experiments) | **ACTIVE** |
| `cota1` | Loads `cota.html` (Archive V1) | **ACTIVE** |
| `cota2` | Loads `replitlastwords.html` (Legacy log) | **ACTIVE** |
| `help` | Lists all available system commands | **SYSTEM** |
| `clear` | Wipes the terminal output history | **SYSTEM** |

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture
To maintain a "No-SaaS" fee structure, this lab is built with:
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Static)
* **Design:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-First via CDN)
* **Commerce:** Stripe Payment Links (No Shopify/Monthly fees)
* **Automations:** Formspree API (Signal tracking) & Google Calendar (Scheduling)

## 👤 Builder Note
I am currently experimenting with adding more service modules. If you are interested in a specific signal or want to collaborate on a "No-SaaS" funnel, type a signal into the terminal or reach out via the contact logs.

**Thank you for being here. You're a legend.**
